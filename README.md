# -MONDAY-CAFE--WEEKLY-PERFORMANCE---MON-SUN-
Welcome to the Monday Cafe Power BI Dashboard Challenge! This project is based on a real production use case from our fictional UAE-based cafe chain — Monday Cafe. The company has 4 branches across the UAE, serving 15 different products, and wants to analyze performance on a weekly basis (Monday → Sunday) using Power BI.
🎯 Dashboard Requirements
KPI Section
Create 3 key performance indicators (KPIs):

Total Sales
Total Quantity Sold
Total Profit [Any sales in dubai 15% profit, Abu Dhabi 12%, Sharjah 9%, Ajman 7%
Each KPI must include:

The current week’s value
The % change vs. the previous week
A visual indicator (up/down arrow or color change)
Example: The dashboard should show last Monday to last Sunday by default.

When the user selects a different week range from the slicer, the dashboard should update accordingly and compare that range to its previous equivalent week range.

Charts to Include
Pie Chart — Product-wise sales contribution
Line Chart — Weekly sales trend (Week on X-axis, Sales on Y-axis)
Bar Chart 1 — Branch-wise sales comparison
Bar Chart 2 — Product-wise total quantity sold
Slicer Configuration
Week slicer should be based on a Monday → Sunday week range.
By default, the report should display data for the most recent completed week.
When users select any week or range, the dashboard should dynamically compare it with the previous week(s).
